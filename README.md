# Energy Efficiency Predictor

A web-based AI application that predicts heating load (energy efficiency) of a building based on its characteristics, using TensorFlow.js and an open-source dataset.

## Features
- Predict energy efficiency (heating load).
- Built using TensorFlow.js and runs entirely in the browser.

## Dataset
- [UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nasirtrekker/testcodeAIEng_energyefficiency.git
